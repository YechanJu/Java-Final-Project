# Java-Final-Project

I usually don't plan my schedules well, so I thought it would be a good idea to create a scheduler. Since I'm working alone on this project, I wanted to avoid making something too complicated. That's why I chose to develop a To-do list GUI, thinking it would be relatively simple as long as I could handle the GUI.

Main Features:
Add Function: You can add tasks using the Add button. When you click Add, you can enter the title, date, and content of the task, then click the confirm button to add it.
Color-Coded Deadlines: Added tasks are displayed in different colors based on their deadlines. Tasks with more than 4 days remaining are shown in white, tasks with 3 days or less remaining are shown in yellow, and overdue tasks are shown in red.
Completion Checkbox: Clicking the checkbox next to an item marks it as completed. You can check completed tasks by clicking the Completed button.
Edit and View Details: Double-clicking an item allows you to edit it, and right-clicking an item shows its details.
Delete Function: You can delete an item by selecting it and clicking the Delete button.

This way, the To-do list application provides a straightforward and effective way to manage tasks.

But, there are some problems need to be fixed.
1.	Fix the issue where clicking the item itself checks the checkbox.
2.	Fix the issue where double-clicking is not properly recognized due to the problem 1.
3.	Fix the issue where an item remains selected even after clicking it again.
4.	Modify the design to use box shapes to better distinguish between items.
5.	Allow date selection using a calendar popup.
6.	Add more features when adding a task (e.g., category selection).
7.	Improve the UI since the current design only includes basic GUI elements
